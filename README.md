# AoC_SingleLine_2023

Goal is to solve as much of Advent of Code 2023 using only a single semicolon anywhere in the code.

Note: Currently 1 of the days I was able to solve by adding a simple (but powerful) 'linq like' extension method.  Decided to include it and just note where I had to slightly cheat on it.
