# AoC_SingleLine_2023

Goal is to solve as much of Advent of Code 2023 using only a single semicolon anywhere in the code.

Requirements:
* Only 1 semicolon
* Runs quickly/efficiently
* Uses only methods built into .NET**

** OK, I ended up adding and using a single small extension method to make many of the later days possible.  It breaks the rules but keeps the spirit of the challenge alive.
