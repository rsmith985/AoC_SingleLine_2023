# AoC_SingleLine_2023

Goal is to solve as much of Advent of Code 2023 using only a single semicolon anywhere in the code.

Requirements:
* Only 1 semicolon
* Runs quickly/efficiently
* Uses only methods built into .NET**

** OK, I already cheated in 1 spot and used a custom extension method (its a simple but powerful 'linq like' method).  Plan to only 'cheat' if absolutely necessary, and if added function still keeps with the spirit of the challenge.
